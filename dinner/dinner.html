                <h2>Chicken Biryani</h2>
                <p> The reason why chicken biryani is so famous is due to the different flavours and the ingredients it carries as well as the nostalgia it evokes as a royal and iconic dish. One of the most common ways to prepare chicken biryani is to layer spiced chicken followed by rice, fried onions, and ghee.</p>

                                            <li>Optionally, garnish with fried onions for added flavor and aroma.</li>
                                            <li>Drizzle some ghee on top of the final rice layer to keep the biryani moist and flavorful.</li>
